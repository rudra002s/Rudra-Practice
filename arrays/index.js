//array is also declared as a variable only with [] and array are mutable which means when we perform a perform original array is changed but in strings when we perform a function it returns a new string and original string is intact

let arr=[1,2,3,4,5]
// index=0,1,2,3,4

console.log(arr)
console.log(arr.length) //to print length of array


console.log(arr[0]) //to print a particular element of an array using its index
console.log(arr[1])
console.log(arr[2])
console.log(arr[3])

arr[0]=555; //here it changed the element of array
